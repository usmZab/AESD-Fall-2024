## RTOS-Codes
This repository contains sample codes for **FreeRTOS** demos.

The codes are based on public-domain sample codes provided in the **FreeRTOS book by Richard Barry** titled "Mastering the FreeRTOS Real Time Kernel".

Please see [official FreeRTOS documentation at freeRTOS.org](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/RTOS_book.html)

I have used these codes, and modified these to run on ESP32 MCU.
